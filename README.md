# Limited Memory Matrix Adaptation exploiting Gradient Information Evolution Strategy
This repository contains an improvement for any covariance-matix-adaptation-like evolution strategy exploiting gradient or its estimation.

## The idea in a nutshell
For a wide variety of problems, the gradient is the most frequently used information to find optimal solutions.
While CMA-like algorithms are state-of-the-art in evolutionary strategies, they can be enhanced by knowing the best direction to take (using gradient information).
This helps to better exploit faster convergence and prevents getting stuck in local minima, thanks to the exploratory properties of CMA

## Deap implementation
The file `utility/es.py` contains the implementation of the original LMMA-ES algorithm proposed in ![this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06693) and the new variant.
